This Privacy Policy describes how **Best Cement** ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our mobile application, **Best Workforce** (the "App").

This App is intended for use by authorized Salesmen and Technical Sales Employees of Best Cement for internal business operations, including attendance, route tracking, dealer management, and reporting.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect specific types of data to enable the core functionality of the App.

### A. Location Data (Coarse and Fine)
We collect your device's precise (GPS) and approximate (network-based) location.
* **When we collect it:** We collect location data when you use features like "Check-In," "Check-Out," "Create PJP," "Add Dealer," and during "Journey/Visit" tracking.
* **Background Location:** If you initiate a "Journey" or "Visit," we collect location data in the background (even when the App is closed or not in use) to track the distance travelled (`totalDistanceTravelled`) and verify site visits via Geofencing (powered by Radar.io).
* **Why we need it:** To verify employee attendance, calculate travel reimbursement based on distance, ensure visits to assigned dealers/sites, and provide navigation assistance.

### B. Personal Information
* **User Identifiers:** Login ID (e.g., EMP/TSE IDs), Name, and Employee ID.
* **Contact Information:** Phone numbers and Email addresses (used for profile management and communication).
* **Mason/Dealer Data:** We collect names, phone numbers, and addresses of dealers and masons you register or visit.

### C. Camera and Photos
We request access to your device's camera and photo gallery.
* **Usage:** To capture "Selfies" for attendance verification (Check-In/Out), to photograph construction sites for Technical Visit Reports (TVR), and to capture documents (Aadhaar, PAN) for KYC verification.
* **Storage:** Images are uploaded to our secure cloud storage (Cloudflare R2) and linked to your reports.

### D. Device and App Information
* **Device Status:** We collect battery level, charging status, and network connectivity status (as seen in our Geotracking logs) to ensure accurate tracking data.
* **App Activity:** We use **Firebase Analytics** to collect data on how you use the app, crash reports, and performance metrics.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected data for the following business purposes:
* **Attendance Management:** Verifying your location and identity (via photo) at the start and end of the workday.
* **Sales & Technical Operations:** managing Dealer and Site databases, processing Orders, and submitting Visit Reports (DVR/TVR).
* **KYC Verification:** Verifying the identity of Masons and Dealers through document uploads.
* **Route Optimization:** Tracking distance travelled to calculate allowances and optimize travel routes.
* **Communication:** Enabling direct calls or WhatsApp messages to dealers/masons via the App.

## 3. Third-Party Services

We share data with or utilize the following third-party services to provide App functionality:
